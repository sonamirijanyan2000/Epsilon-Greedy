**The definition of problem**

In order to demonstrate the products to customers,
the most widely spread way is sending emails nowadays. 
However, everyone would agree that before doing that, 
no one initially knows the customers' needs and preferences. 
Thus, the best way to send emails is to pass a survey with 
them and analyze it, thus getting some statistical data. 
However, the most significant issue is how many receivers 
will open the emails and pass the survey. A way with the 
help of which we can solve this problem is to do our best 
and send as many emails as possible. Afterward, we can 
collect our data and make a target list by including those 
people with a higher response rate. 
  
  
**First Plot**

**X-axis:** Stands for the number of times algorithm has been able to drag on any of the 5 accessible arms. 

**Y-axis:** Stands for displaying the probability line [0,1]. For instance, call select_arm() selects the best of the 5 arms for  X every value.

In case a higher epsilon algorithm tries to find the best arm. After getting it, the algorithm studies, which is not worth doing anymore.
For the value of 0.01, the algorithm reaches its Trade-off point and algortihm is focused on time's length.

**Second Plot**

 Averaging the values provides more relevant results as there could be arms that are periodically 
 identical to the best arm. Besides, it is not as good in some cases, and averaging will supply 
 more comprehensible plots. 

**Third Plot**

To determine if risen exploration is worth the risk, we must focus on cumulative performance over time. 
This can be beneficial initially while no arm is explored, enabling the algorithm to explore.
